# Rabbit's Journey
2D videogame project made for the Master at UOC on the subject Programming in Unity 2D. 
The art and the resources were taken by free online game assets.

We should make a 2D platform game where the assets like pictures, characters, music, etc. could be online and free, so I decided
to take the background and the platforms of a free Unity resource. The rocks, the character and the music was mainly taken on
opengameart.org. 
The code <folder Scripts inside Assets> was made by myself.

This 2D platform game has an options menu, instructions, controls page and credits. Also, has two different levels which you can 
play! If anytime you need to quit or pause the game, you can do it by clicking the ESC key.

For more information, questions or any change you think that would be suitable for the game, please don't hesitate to contact me at
my e-mail -lorena.arriaga.94@gmail.com-.

Hope you enjoy it!
